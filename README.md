# Rethinking the frontend with HTMX

- HTMX is a tiny javascript library which basically allows you to trigger Ajax calls and deal with the responses using attributes set in html tags. The big thing is that it expects the responses to be html snippets, which it can then place in the current page.

- So a simple usecase is that an ajax call is triggered and the response is html that is used to replace the element that triggered the call. I looked that this and tried it out. My first thought was WHY!! A second look, then a third and I began to see why HTMX could possibly change Front end in a huge way, especially if your using a good backend with a powerful templating engine.
